            My Dearest Gauri,

On this special day of love, I want to take a moment to remind you just how much you mean to me. Words may never truly capture the depth of my feelings, but today, Iâ€™ll try my best to express what my heart holds for you.

From the very first moment our paths crossed, youâ€™ve been a whirlwind in my lifeâ€”sometimes like a calming breeze, and sometimes like a storm with all your fiery anger. But no matter what, I cherish every shade of you. Your anger, your kindness, your stubbornness, and your laughterâ€”everything about you makes you unique, makes you you, and thatâ€™s exactly what I love the most.

Your presence alone makes my world brighter, warmer, and infinitely more beautiful. Thereâ€™s something about the way you carry yourself, with strength and confidence, that leaves me in awe. Even in the moments when youâ€™re fuming, thereâ€™s this undeniable spark in your eyes that tells me you care, that you feel deeply, and that your heart is pure gold beneath all that fire. And honestly? I wouldnâ€™t have you any other way.

Gauri, you are my constant, my safe space, my person. No matter how much we bicker or how many times you roll your eyes at me, deep down, I know that thereâ€™s a connection between us that words cannot define. Itâ€™s in the way we understand each other, in the way I can sense your emotions even when you say nothing, in the way your happiness feels like my own.

This Valentineâ€™s Day, I want you to know that you are irreplaceable. You are the chaos I adore, the strength I admire, and the love I never knew I needed until you came into my life. Every single day, I am grateful for youâ€”for your kindness, your sharp wit, your passion, and even your occasional (or frequent) outbursts. Because through it all, one thing remains unchanged: you are mine, and I am yours.

So, hereâ€™s to usâ€”to every laugh, every argument, every adventure, and every quiet moment we share. No matter what the future holds, one thing is certain: I will always choose you.

Happy Valentineâ€™s Day, Gauri. ðŸ’–

Forever Yours,
Divyansh Dubey
